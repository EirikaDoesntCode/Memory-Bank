Got distracted by life after watching this one but lets see what i remember anyway

He made a plane by creating a cube and stretching it, though later brushed past another object type that was an actual plane, 
maybe there's some functional difference between the two or maybe showing off cube first was just simpler

added phsyics to objects by giving them rigid body components and making sure they have collision components

showed off colouring a cube it meterial map? i kinda spaced out and missed this properly

showed off the default window layout and the scene and play screen, moving windows around, being able to reset them to defualt if you need.
showed how you can edit stuff in scene, whikle tis playing though noted it can be a little buggy with physics

object properties *are* components
